### Theory
 Let for all **x** belongs to set of prime numbers the number of prime numbers before that **x** is given by **P(x)** and let a  funtion **y(t)** such that for **y(x)**=**P(x)** for all **t**=**x** .
- **y(t)** < **t**.
- **y(t)** is increasing function.
- **y'(t)** is decreasing function.
